/**
 * src and dist
 * -------------
 * When dealing with Webpack, there are 2 very important directories: 'src' (source) and 'dist' (distribution)
 * src is where we keep all of our website's source code, essentially where all of our work will be done (with an exception being altering any configuration files in the root of the project)
 * When we run Webpack to bundle our code, it will output the bundled files into the dist directory
 * 
 * Work inside 'src', build into 'dist', then deploy!
